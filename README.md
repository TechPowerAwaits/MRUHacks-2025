# Alchemy Tinder

### A Godot-based gamified chemistry project that matches elements to create compound.

## Overview
#### Alchemy Tinder is a game that lets players join elements to form new ones. Think of it as â€œlinking elements" where elements mix, react, and create new ones.  

#### Players start with a single element and are presented with other  elements, in which they must choose which ones to combine with. When they choose the right one they go on to the next one step if not they get a fun comment.
