# Alchemy Tinder

A Godot-based chemical dating simulator, where you match with elements to create compounds.

## Overview

Alchemy Tinder is a game where you must join elements through a tinder interface to form compounds. Think of it as "linking elements" where elements must mix, react, and combine.

Players start with a single element and must use their logical abilities to create specialized elements, with unique educational blurbs on every combination.
