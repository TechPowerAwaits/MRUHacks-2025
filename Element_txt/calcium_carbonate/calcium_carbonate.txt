Oxygen + Carbon + Calcium = Correct
Oxygen + Carbon + Hydrogen = Hydrogen bonds with carbon to form hydrocarbons (like methane, CH₄), not carbonates. Hydrogen likes to keep it simple with carbon and make gases, not stable solids like carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Helium = Helium is a noble gas and doesn’t react with oxygen or carbon. It’s perfectly content floating around and doesn’t form compounds like carbonates because it has a full electron shell.
Oxygen + Carbon + Lithium = Lithium reacts with oxygen to form lithium oxide (Li₂O). Lithium likes simple oxides and doesn’t go for the complexity of carbonates. It prefers bonding with oxygen in a simple, straightforward way.
Oxygen + Carbon + Beryllium = Beryllium forms beryllium oxide (BeO) with oxygen. It’s all about oxides for beryllium, as it doesn’t bond with carbon to form carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Boron = Boron reacts with oxygen to form boron oxide (B₂O₃). Boron is all about forming oxides and doesn’t need carbon to make carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Nitrogen = Nitrogen reacts with oxygen to form nitrogen oxides (NO, NO₂). Nitrogen prefers forming gases like these with oxygen and doesn’t get involved with carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Fluorine = Fluorine bonds with oxygen to form oxygen difluoride (OF₂). Fluorine’s too reactive and prefers forming fluorides, not carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Neon = Neon is a noble gas and doesn’t react with oxygen or carbon. It’s all about staying inert and doesn’t form any compounds, especially not carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Sodium = Sodium reacts with oxygen to form sodium oxide (Na₂O). Sodium is focused on making simple oxides and doesn’t bond with carbon to form carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Magnesium = Magnesium bonds with oxygen to form magnesium oxide (MgO). It prefers oxides and doesn’t interact with carbon to form carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Aluminum = Aluminum forms aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) with oxygen. Aluminum likes making oxide layers to protect itself, rather than forming carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Silicon = Silicon bonds with oxygen to form silicon dioxide (SiO₂). Silicon loves making glass and sand, not carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Phosphorus = Phosphorus reacts with oxygen to form phosphorus oxides (P₄O₆, P₄O₁₀). Phosphorus focuses on making oxides and doesn’t form carbonates with carbon.
Oxygen + Carbon + Sulfur = Sulfur reacts with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide (SO₂) or sulfur trioxide (SO₃). Sulfur prefers acidic oxides over carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Chlorine = Chlorine forms chlorine monoxide (ClO) or chlorine dioxide (ClO₂) with oxygen. Chlorine is more interested in making reactive compounds than forming carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Argon = Argon is a noble gas and doesn’t react with oxygen or carbon. It’s completely non-reactive and doesn’t form compounds like carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Potassium = Potassium reacts with oxygen to form potassium oxide (K₂O). Potassium likes making basic oxides and doesn’t work with carbon to form carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Scandium = Scandium reacts with oxygen to form scandium oxide (Sc₂O₃). Scandium is into oxides, not carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Titanium = Titanium bonds with oxygen to form titanium dioxide (TiO₂). Titanium loves making tough oxides and doesn’t make carbonates with carbon.
Oxygen + Carbon + Vanadium = Vanadium forms vanadium oxides (V₂O₅, VO₂) with oxygen. Vanadium prefers bonding with oxygen to make oxides, not carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Chromium = Chromium reacts with oxygen to form chromium oxide (Cr₂O₃). Chromium sticks to oxides, not carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Manganese = Manganese forms manganese oxides (MnO₂, Mn₂O₃) when it reacts with oxygen. Manganese focuses on oxides and doesn’t form carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Iron = Iron reacts with oxygen to form iron oxide (Fe₂O₃), or rust. Iron’s too busy making rust to form carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Cobalt = Cobalt reacts with oxygen to form cobalt oxide (CoO). Cobalt prefers making metal oxides over carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Nickel = Nickel bonds with oxygen to form nickel oxide (NiO). Nickel is more into oxides than carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Copper = Copper reacts with oxygen to form copper oxide (CuO). Copper likes making oxides rather than bonding with carbon for carbonates.
Oxygen + Carbon + Zinc = Zinc reacts with oxygen to form zinc oxide (ZnO). Zinc is more focused on making oxides and doesn’t form carbonates with carbon.
