Oxygen + Carbon = Correct
Oxygen + Hydrogen = Hydrogen and oxygen team up to form water (H₂O), not a carbonate. Water is just way too good at bonding to do anything else with carbon.
Oxygen + Helium = Helium is a noble gas and just hangs out by itself. It doesn’t react with oxygen or carbon because its electron shell is already full and it’s too cool to bond.
Oxygen + Lithium = Lithium prefers to react with oxygen to form lithium oxide (Li₂O), not a carbonate. It likes keeping things simple and doesn’t do carbonates.
Oxygen + Beryllium = Beryllium reacts with oxygen to form beryllium oxide (BeO). It’s all about stable oxides and doesn’t get into carbonates.
Oxygen + Boron = Boron forms boron oxide (B₂O₃) when it bonds with oxygen. It’s not into making carbonates—it prefers simpler oxide compounds.
Oxygen + Nitrogen = Nitrogen likes to form nitrogen oxides (NO, NO₂), not carbonates. It prefers to bond with oxygen for those gases, especially when it’s hot!
Oxygen + Fluorine = Fluorine forms oxygen difluoride (OF₂) when reacting with oxygen. Fluorine is too reactive to make carbonates—it’s focused on making powerful fluorides instead.
Oxygen + Neon = Neon is another noble gas that just doesn't react. It has a full electron shell and prefers to stay isolated, not making any compounds like carbonates.
Oxygen + Sodium = Sodium and oxygen form sodium oxide (Na₂O), not a carbonate. Sodium’s more interested in making basic oxides than mixing with carbon.
Oxygen + Magnesium = Magnesium reacts with oxygen to form magnesium oxide (MgO). It’s about oxides, not carbonates, for this metal.
Oxygen + Aluminum = Aluminum forms aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) when it reacts with oxygen. Aluminum’s pretty good at making protective oxide layers instead of carbonates.
Oxygen + Silicon = Silicon forms silicon dioxide (SiO₂), a major component of sand. Silicon’s into bonding with oxygen for glass and rocks, not carbonates.
Oxygen + Phosphorus = Phosphorus creates phosphorus oxides (P₄O₆, P₄O₁₀), not carbonates. It’s all about making oxides, not combining with carbon for carbonates.
Oxygen + Sulfur = Sulfur bonds with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide (SO₂) or sulfur trioxide (SO₃), but not carbonates. Sulfur’s more interested in forming acidic oxides.
Oxygen + Chlorine = Chlorine reacts with oxygen to make chlorine monoxide (ClO) or chlorine dioxide (ClO₂). Chlorine prefers making reactive compounds with oxygen, not carbonates.
Oxygen + Argon = Argon is a noble gas and doesn't react with oxygen. It’s got a full electron shell and just enjoys being non-reactive, not forming carbonates.
Oxygen + Potassium = Potassium reacts with oxygen to form potassium oxide (K₂O) or potassium peroxide (K₂O₂). Potassium loves making oxides, not carbonates.
Oxygen + Calcium = Calcium prefers forming calcium oxide (CaO) with oxygen. It’s all about strong, simple oxides, not carbonates.
Oxygen + Scandium = Scandium reacts with oxygen to form scandium oxide (Sc₂O₃), not a carbonate. Scandium is into stable oxides, not carbonates.
Oxygen + Titanium = Titanium forms titanium dioxide (TiO₂) when it reacts with oxygen. Titanium is into making tough oxides, not carbonates.
Oxygen + Vanadium = Vanadium reacts with oxygen to form vanadium oxides (V₂O₅, VO₂), not carbonates. Vanadium's not into carbonates—it prefers making oxide compounds.
Oxygen + Chromium = Chromium reacts with oxygen to form chromium oxide (Cr₂O₃). It’s more about making metal oxides than carbonates.
Oxygen + Manganese = Manganese combines with oxygen to form manganese oxides (MnO₂, Mn₂O₃). Manganese’s focus is on oxides, not carbonates.
Oxygen + Iron = Iron bonds with oxygen to form iron oxide (Fe₂O₃), also known as rust. Iron’s busy making rust, not carbonates.
Oxygen + Cobalt = Cobalt forms cobalt oxide (CoO) when it reacts with oxygen. Cobalt prefers making oxide compounds over carbonates.
Oxygen + Nickel = Nickel reacts with oxygen to form nickel oxide (NiO). Nickel loves its oxides and doesn’t make carbonates.
Oxygen + Copper = Copper reacts with oxygen to form copper oxide (CuO). Copper’s more into making oxide layers, not carbonates.
Oxygen + Zinc = Zinc reacts with oxygen to form zinc oxide (ZnO). Zinc is all about forming oxides, not carbonates.
