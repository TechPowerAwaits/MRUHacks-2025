Oxygen+Hydrogen=Correct
Oxygen + Helium = Helium just hangs out, doing its own thing. It’s too lazy to react with oxygen because it’s already got a full electron shell!
Oxygen + Lithium = Lithium is super excited and reacts with oxygen to form lithium oxide (Li₂O), a stable compound. Lithium’s always ready to bond!
Oxygen + Beryllium = Beryllium reacts with oxygen to form beryllium oxide (BeO). It’s strong and forms a protective layer to keep the metal from rusting.
Oxygen + Boron = Boron bonds with oxygen to form boron oxide (B₂O₃), a solid that’s often used in things like glass production.
Oxygen + Carbon = Carbon combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide (CO₂), a gas that’s essential for plants and gives us that "breathe-out" feeling.
Oxygen + Nitrogen = Nitrogen and oxygen don’t normally react at room temperature, but when they’re super hot, they form nitrogen oxides (NO, NO₂), which can contribute to pollution.
Oxygen + Fluorine = Fluorine loves to react and creates oxygen difluoride (OF₂) when mixed with oxygen. It’s highly reactive—just like fluorine!
Oxygen + Neon = Neon doesn’t react with oxygen. It’s a noble gas and prefers to keep to itself, not interested in bonding with anyone.
Oxygen + Sodium = Sodium reacts quickly with oxygen to form sodium oxide (Na₂O). It’s very reactive, so you’d better be careful around it!
Oxygen + Magnesium = Magnesium burns brightly in air, creating magnesium oxide (MgO), a white powder. It's used in fireproof materials!
Oxygen + Aluminum = Aluminum forms aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) when it reacts with oxygen, which actually protects it from rusting.
Oxygen + Silicon = Silicon reacts with oxygen to make silicon dioxide (SiO₂), the main ingredient in sand. So, yes, you’re walking on silicon dioxide at the beach!
Oxygen + Phosphorus = Phosphorus burns with oxygen to create phosphorus oxides (P₄O₆, P₄O₁₀). It’s super reactive, especially white phosphorus!
Oxygen + Sulfur = Sulfur reacts with oxygen to make sulfur dioxide (SO₂), a gas that can lead to acid rain if there’s too much of it in the air.
Oxygen + Chlorine = Chlorine and oxygen can react to make chlorine monoxide (ClO), but it’s a tricky reaction, and it’s usually not something we see much in everyday life.
Oxygen + Argon = Argon doesn’t react with oxygen because it’s a noble gas. It’s content being all alone in its full electron shell.
Oxygen + Potassium = Potassium reacts quickly with oxygen to form potassium oxide (K₂O), which can catch fire. It’s a pretty energetic metal!
Oxygen + Calcium = Calcium reacts with oxygen to form calcium oxide (CaO), which is a key ingredient in cement and making concrete.
Oxygen + Scandium = Scandium reacts with oxygen to form scandium oxide (Sc₂O₃), a compound used in some specialized alloys.
Oxygen + Titanium = Titanium reacts with oxygen to form titanium dioxide (TiO₂), a compound used in paint, sunscreen, and even food coloring.
Oxygen + Vanadium = Vanadium reacts with oxygen to form vanadium oxides (V₂O₅, VO₂), which are used in steelmaking to improve strength and resistance.
Oxygen + Chromium = Chromium reacts with oxygen to form chromium oxide (Cr₂O₃), which is used to make chrome plating for cars and other shiny things.
Oxygen + Manganese = Manganese reacts with oxygen to form manganese oxides (MnO₂, Mn₂O₃), which are used in batteries and as catalysts.
Oxygen + Iron = Iron reacts with oxygen to form iron oxide (Fe₂O₃), better known as rust. It’s a slow process, but it’s always happening when iron meets air.
Oxygen + Cobalt = Cobalt reacts with oxygen to form cobalt oxide (CoO), a black powder used in magnets and batteries.
Oxygen + Nickel = Nickel reacts with oxygen to form nickel oxide (NiO), a greenish compound used in rechargeable batteries.
Oxygen + Copper = Copper reacts with oxygen over time, creating copper oxide (CuO), which turns green—this is what gives copper its signature patina.
Oxygen + Zinc = Zinc reacts with oxygen to form zinc oxide (ZnO), which is used in sunscreen to protect your skin from UV rays.
